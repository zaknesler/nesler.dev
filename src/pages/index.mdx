I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. In the meantime, I like to work on side projects and contribute what I can to open source.

If you would like to get in touch, please feel free to take a look at my [résumé](/resume) or send me an [email](mailto:zak@nesler.dev), and I'll get back to you!
