#### College

This year is my senior year of my B.S. degree in Computer Science. My current courses include Web Dev II, Assembly + Compiler Design, and Concurrent + Quantum Computing.

#### Web Development

Over the past year I have been diving into learning React + Next.js, and as I wrap up my degree, I'd like to continue to progress though the React ecosystem. I have also been using Inertia.js for some personal projects, and have found it to be a great way to work.

#### Adventures into Art

In November 2019 I began my venture into art, where I started learning the basics of 3D using [Blender](https://blender.org), an incredibly powerful, open-source 3D suite. I have had a blast learning about 3D modeling, physics/fluid simulations, and creating awesome scenes in general, all using free tutorials on YouTube.

After becoming addicted to Blender and devouring all the content I could, I switched over to learning traditional and digital art. After taking a few art classes in college, including Drawing/Composition and Sculpture, I have only found my interest developing further. Currently, when I find the time, I enjoy practicing portraits and anatomy.

My next milestone is to get more into painting, both traditional or digital, and delving into color theory.
