#### Work

After I graduated, I moved to Philly and started a full-time position as a full-stack engineer, and I am loving the hell out of it.

#### Currently Learning

I've been using tRPC a ton now, and the time saved from coupling the front-end and API layers together is unmatched. Super satisfying!

Outside of JS-land, I've been using Go and Rust a bunch, mostly for various CLI + web apps. Once you get over the hurdles, specifically those brought by Rust, it becomes so much fun to learn and use.

#### Adventures into Art

In November 2019 I began my venture into art, where I started learning the basics of 3D using [Blender](https://blender.org), an incredibly powerful and open-source 3D suite. All using free tutorials on YouTube.

Not long after, I switched over to learning traditional and digital art. After taking a few art classes in college, such as drawing/composition, sculpture, & color theory, I have only found my interest developing further.

When I find the time and motivation, I'll practice drawing portraits and work on my understanding of anatomy.
