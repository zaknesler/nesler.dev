#### College

This year I graduated cum laude from Wilkes University with a B.S. degree in Computer Science and as a recipient of the Outstanding Senior Award in Computer Science.

#### Web Development

Over the past year I have been diving into learning React + Next.js, and as I wrap up my degree, I'd like to continue to progress though the React ecosystem.

On the side I have been playing around with languages such as Go and Rust and look forward to using them more in the future, especially Rust!

#### Adventures into Art

In November 2019 I began my venture into art, where I started learning the basics of 3D using [Blender](https://blender.org), an incredibly powerful, open-source 3D suite. I have had a blast learning about 3D modeling, physics/fluid simulations, and creating awesome scenes in general, all using free tutorials on YouTube.

After becoming addicted to Blender and devouring all the content I could, I switched over to learning traditional and digital art. After taking a few art classes in college, including Drawing/Composition and Sculpture, I have only found my interest developing further. Recently, when I find the time, I have been practicing portraits and anatomy.

My next milestone is to get more into painting, both traditional or digital, and delving futher into color theory.
