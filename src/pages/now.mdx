#### College

This year I graduated cum laude from Wilkes University with a B.S. degree in Computer Science and as a recipient of the Outstanding Senior Award in Computer Science.

Having developed my thought process for problem solving, I am now starting as a full-time software engineer and I'm ready to take on new challenges.

#### Currently Learning

I'm getting much more into the JavaScript ecosystem, and I'm currently working with TypeScript and React.

On the side I have been playing around with Go and Rust. They are tremendously fun to use, specifically Rust, and I'm already using them on a few projects.

#### Adventures into Art

In November 2019 I began my venture into art, where I started learning the basics of 3D using [Blender](https://blender.org), an incredibly powerful, open-source 3D suite. I have had a blast learning about 3D modeling, physics/fluid simulations, and creating awesome scenes in general, all using free tutorials on YouTube.

After becoming addicted to Blender and devouring all the content I could, I switched over to learning traditional and digital art. After taking a few art classes in college, including Drawing/Composition and Sculpture, I have only found my interest developing further. Recently, when I find the time, I have been practicing portraits and anatomy.

My next milestone is to get more into painting, both traditional or digital, and delving futher into color theory.
