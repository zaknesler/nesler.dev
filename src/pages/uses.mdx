import Layout from '../components/Layout'

This is a collection of software, hardware, apps, and websites I use daily. More than anything, this is a place for me to keep track of everything I use and to act as a catalog if I need to look something up in the future.

There is an overwhelming amount of superlatives on this page, but it is only because most of the tools I use are the result of years of searching, switching, and customizing until I have found the absolute best for my workflow.

#### Development

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

  Around the start of 2020, I switched to using VS Code as my primary editor, and I absolutely love it. It is highly customizable and has a huge community behind it. I use [GitHub](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) as my light theme and [Atomize](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emroussel.atomize-atom-one-dark-theme) as my dark theme.

- [Sublime Text 3](https://sublimetext.com)

  For the longest time, Sublime has been my editor of choice, and to this day nothing comes close to its speed. I will forever stand behind my $70 purchase.

  I use a [highly-customized](https://gist.github.com/zaknesler/436c4d7e6c607321e2a56de9e28795e8) theme for [DA UI](https://github.com/Krypto/sublime-da-ui), and my favorite color scheme is DA Light, which is found in the [DA CS](https://github.com/Krypto/sublime-da-cs) package.

- [Brave](https://brave.com)

  Brave is Chrome without Google! I have tried many times to switch to Firefox, but it has never quite worked out.

- [Docker](https://docker.com)

  My daily development environment. Docker is pure magic and is so much fun to use!

- [Figma](https://figma.com)

  Hands-down the best design tool you can use, plus it's web-based and collaborative. I mean, come on!

- [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com)

  My preferred terminal for macOS. Highly customizable and very reliable.

- [Windows Terminal](https://microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701)

  A fantastic terminal that supports multiple environments. You can have Ubuntu, Command Prompt, PowerShell, etc. running in the same window. It's sweet!

  I also use [Cmder](https://cmder.net) as a console emulator for work on the Windows filesystem, you just point Windows Terminal to the batch file and you're set.

#### Hosting

- [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/?refcode=704e28ee95b8)

  An amazing cloud-hosting provider that offers many amazing additional services. Very easy to spin up a droplet to test out projects or software.

- [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com)

  A complete life-saver; it makes it incredibly easy to maintain Laravel applications. Everything from databases to daemons can be managed on a web interface.

- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)

  No explanation is needed! Cloudflare is awesome.

- [GitHub](https://github.com)

  Huge fan! Since its acquisition by Microsoft, it has only been getting better.

- [Hover](https://hover.com)

  I've been through at least three other domain registrars; Hover has a super clean UI and incredible customer support.

#### Productivity

- [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com)

  I am adamant about putting every future event, including my college and work schedule, into my Calendar. Upcoming events are displayed on my phone and I never have to worry about missing anything.

- [Alfred](https://alfredapp.com)

  Did someone say productivity? Boy, does this program speed up your workflow. It's literally how I navigate on my Mac.

- [1Password](https://1password.com)

  Speechless. I couldn't imagine my life without 1Password.

- [Bear](https://bear.app)

  I use Bear because I love Markdown! I take all of my notes for college with this.

- [FastMail](https://fastmail.com)

  I use this to handle my domain email addresses. $50 a year for virtually unlimited domains and aliases is such a great deal.

#### Personal

- [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com)

  Reputable, fast, inexpensive. I'm always connected to a VPN and you should be as well.

- [Google One](https://one.google.com)

  I use Google One (Google Drive) for backing up important data and syncing between devices.

- [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org)

  Incredibly useful program for maintaining backups on external drives. It can diff files and directories and only copy over changed/new files.

- [Plex](https://plex.tv)

  A great media streaming solution. Buy your favorite shows, movies, and music and own them forever!

- [Foobar2000](https://foobar2000.com)

  What year is it again? Yeah, I still use Foobar cause I love FLAC!

- [Spotify](https://spotify.com)

  Great way to discover new artists and listen while driving.

#### Apps

- [Bobby](https://bobbyapp.co)

  Useful little app for keeping track of all of any subscriptions and recurring billing. Includes weekly, monthly, and yearly cost-breakdowns.

- [Signal](https://signal.org)

  Open-source, encrypted messaging!

- [Unified Remove](https://unifiedremote.com)

  A handy app for controlling your computer remotely. More than just a wireless mouse and keyboard, it has support for popular applications and websites as well.

#### Hardware

- **13" MacBook Pro &ndash; 2016**

  2.9 GHz Dual-core i5, 8 GB 2133 MHz. Light, portable, and fast!

- **Custom Windows 10 PC**

  I built this PC in ~2014 and I've been slowly upgrading its specs ever since; it's something I've put quite a lot of work into, and I am very happy with it!
