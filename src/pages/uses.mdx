This is a bunch of software, hardware, apps, and websites I use daily.

There are a lot of superlatives on this page, but only because this is the result of years of searching, switching, and customizing until I have found the most ideal for my workflow.

#### Development

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)

  Around the start of 2020, I switched to using VS Code as my primary editor, and I absolutely love it. It is nicely customizable and has a huge community behind it. I use [GitHub](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) for my light/dark themes.

- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

  I've slowly been transferring from VScode to nvim, and it's only a matter of time before I take the leap completely.

- [Brave](https://brave.com)

  Brave is Chrome without Google; I have tried many times to switch to Firefox, but it has never quite worked out.

- [Docker](https://docker.com)

  Docker is so much fun to use, and quite possibly the most satisfying tool I have ever used.

- [Figma](https://figma.com)

  Hands-down the best design tool you can use, plus it's web-based and collaborative.

- [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com)

  My preferred terminal for macOS. At this point I don't know why.

- [Windows Terminal](https://microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701)

  When using Windows, this is a great terminal that supports multiple environments. You can have Ubuntu, Command Prompt, PowerShell, etc. running in the same window.

  I also use [Cmder](https://cmder.net) as a console emulator for work on the Windows filesystem, you just point Windows Terminal to the batch file and you're set.

#### Hosting

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

  Perfect for Next.js apps and static sites.

- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com)

  Database-as-a-service platform. Super friendly to use.

- [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/?refcode=704e28ee95b8)

  It's kinda nice having your own VPS (and not too expensive, either). I use it for a few personal projects.

- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)
- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Hover](https://hover.com)


#### Productivity

- [Notion](https://notion.so)

  Great tool to help keep your life organized.

- [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com)

  I've got anxiety, so I use Google Calendar to keep track of every future event.

- [Raycast](https://raycast.com)

  A great alternative to Alfred and Spotlight. Highly customizable, nicely designed, and *blazingly fast!*

- [1Password](https://1password.com)

  I couldn't imagine my life without 1Password.

- [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com)

  Cross-platform mail client. Sometimes fumbly, but overall pretty good!

- [FastMail](https://fastmail.com)

  I use this to handle my domain email addresses. $50 a year for virtually unlimited domains and aliases is such a great deal.

#### Personal

- [Plex](https://plex.tv)

  A great media streaming solution. Buy your favorite shows, movies, and music and own them forever!

- [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com)
- [Google One](https://one.google.com)
- [Spotify](https://spotify.com)
- [foobar2000](https://foobar2000.com)

#### Hardware

- **Synology DS920+**

  4-bay NAS. I use this to store all of my media and to host Docker containers, such as Plex. Super convenient to set up and manage.

  I'm running it with 4× WD Red Plus 14TB drives in RAID 10.

- **13" MacBook Pro &ndash; 2016**

  2.9 GHz Dual-core i5, 8 GB 2133 MHz

- **Windows 11 PC**

  I originally built this in ~2014 and I've been slowly upgrading it ever since.
