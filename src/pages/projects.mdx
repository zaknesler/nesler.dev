Here are some of the public projects I've worked on. Most of them are just for fun; some served a purpose, some were just to learn something new.

#### [Vine](https://github.com/ketyl/vine)

Vine is a simple PHP micro-framework that I built from scratch. It was a great learning experience to get deep into routing, middleware, and the request life-cycle. It's _not_ something intended to be production-ready.

#### [TexBot](https://github.com/zaknesler/texbot)

Discord Bot that parses and converts LaTeX expressions into PNGs. It started as a project for a concurrency/quantum computing class.

It uses the concurrency features of Go and several command-line tools for processing, all wrapped up inside a Docker container.

#### Laravel Projects

These are some of my personal Laravel projects I've worked on, mostly for fun.

- **Pastebin Clone** â€” [Front-end](https://github.com/zaknesler/pastebin-client) & [Back-end](https://github.com/zaknesler/pastebin-api)

  A cute, simple clone of Pastebin with configurable options for expiring pastes, syntax highlighting with multiple languages, and paste visibility.

- **Shopping Cart** â€” [Front-end](https://github.com/zaknesler/cart-client) & [Back-end](https://github.com/zaknesler/cart-api)

  Shopping/e-commerce application, based on a [Codecourse series](https://codecourse.com/courses/build-an-e-commerce-platform), with added support for flexibly attaching a country & country division (state, province, etc.) to an address.

- [Socialite Demo](https://github.com/zaknesler/socialite-demo)

  Demo application of the laravel/socialite package, with ability to connect multiple authentication methods to a single user account.

- [Stripe Demo](https://github.com/zaknesler/stripe-demo)

  Basic application that utilizes the Stripe API for buying products, checking out, and interacting with Stripe's webhooks.

- [Lynk](https://github.com/zaknesler/lynk)

  Customizable URL-shortener, originally for an assignment for a high-school class. One of my first Laravel projects.

- [Forum](https://github.com/zaknesler/forum)

  My first Laravel project, which is a forum application with basic administrative features, such a reporting posts and essential moderation.

#### [Slim Skeleton](https://github.com/zaknesler/slim)

Project scaffolding for Slim 4 micro-framework applications. Useful for extremely basic projects that won't benefit from a general framework like Laravel, although the project is structured like a Laravel application.

#### [Tailwind CSS Preset](https://github.com/zaknesler/tailwind-preset)

An awesome minimal preset for Laravel 7+ using Tailwind CSS and Vue.js, as well as Laravel Mix and configuration for Tailwind's built-in Purge CSS. A perfect starting point for your next idea.

#### [Projects](https://github.com/zaknesler/projects) & [CSS](https://github.com/zaknesler/css)

These repositories are used to demo how to recreate sites like Google, GitHub, and Reddit using vanilla CSS and Tailwind CSS, along with any other design concepts.

#### [Java/Android Projects](https://github.com/zaknesler/java)

Code from my high school Java I (intro to Java) and Java II (Android Development) classes. These projects allowed me to understand Java more thoroughly, as well as being able to use external APIs to populate a UI.

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Content title="Projects">
    <div className="prose dark:prose-dark">{children}</div>
  </Content>
)
