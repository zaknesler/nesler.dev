#### College

This year I will be starting my senior year of my B.S. degree in Computer Science. My courses include Operating Systems and Web Development, as well as several art classes.

#### Web Development

This past year I have taken a bit of a hiatus from web development to focus on my creative skills, however I still try to keep up to date on all that's happening. I have plans to continue learning React/Next.js, GraphQL, and possibly other web frameworks.

#### Adventures into Art

In November 2019 I began my venture into art, where I started learning the basics of 3D using [Blender](https://blender.org), an incredibly powerful, open-source 3D suite. I have had a blast learning about 3D modeling, physics/fluid simulations, and creating awesome scenes in general, all using free tutorials on YouTube.

After becoming addicted to Blender and devouring all the content I could, I switched over to learning traditional and digital art. This past year I have been practicing gesture, figure drawing, and anatomy, albeit at a snail's pace.

Having discovered a creative side I didn't know I had, I plan on continuing my journey into art. I had always been into photography but could never find the motivation to learn other forms of art. I try to find time every day to practice my skills as an artist, and I don't ever plan on stopping!
