import Layout from '../components/Layout'

**Hey!** I'm Zak, a full-stack developer from Pennsylvania with a passion for clean design and tidy code.

I am a huge fan of the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) PHP framework, the [Vue](https://vuejs.org) JavaScript framework, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), a utility-first CSS framework; I would consider myself to be very proficient in each.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. In the meantime, I like to work on side projects and contribute what I can to open source.

If you would like to get in touch, please feel free to take a look at my [rÃ©sumÃ©](/resume) or send me an [email](mailto:zak@nesler.dev), and I'll get back to you!

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Layout>
    <div className="prose dark:prose-dark">{children}</div>
  </Layout>
