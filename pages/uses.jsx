          This is a collection of software, hardware, apps, and websites I use daily. More than anything, this is a
          place for me to keep track of everything I use and to act as a catalog if I need to look something up in the
          future.

          There is an overwhelming amount of superlatives on this page, but it is only because most of the tools I use
          are the result of years of searching, switching, and customizing until I have found the absolute best for my
          workflow.
        </p>

        <h4>Development</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>
            <p>
              Around the start of 2020, I switched to using VS Code as my primary editor, and I absolutely love it. It
              is highly customizable and has a huge community behind it. I use{' '}
              <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme">GitHub</a> as my
              light theme and{' '}
              <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emroussel.atomize-atom-one-dark-theme">
                Atomize
              </a>{' '}
              as my dark theme.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <a href="https://sublimetext.com">Sublime Text 3</a>
            <p>
              For the longest time, Sublime has been my editor of choice, and to this day nothing comes close to its
              speed. I will forever stand by my $70 purchase and still find excuses to use it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I use a <a href="https://gist.github.com/zaknesler/436c4d7e6c607321e2a56de9e28795e8">highly-customized</a>{' '}
              theme for <a href="https://github.com/Krypto/sublime-da-ui">DA UI</a>, and my favorite color scheme is DA
              Light, which is found in the <a href="https://github.com/Krypto/sublime-da-cs">DA CS</a> package.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <a href="https://brave.com">Brave</a>
            <p>
              Brave is Chrome without Google! I have tried many times to switch to Firefox, but it has never quite
              worked out.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a>
            <p>My daily development environment. Docker is pure magic and is so much fun to use!</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <a href="https://figma.com">Figma</a>

          <li>
            <a href="https://iterm2.com">iTerm 2</a>
            <p>My preferred terminal for macOS. Highly customizable and very reliable.</p>

          <li>
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701">Windows Terminal</a>
            <p>
              A fantastic terminal that supports multiple environments. You can have Ubuntu, Command Prompt, PowerShell,
              etc. running in the same window. It's sweet!
            </p>
            <p>
              I also use <a href="https://cmder.net">Cmder</a> as a console emulator for work on the Windows filesystem,
              you just point Windows Terminal to the batch file and you're set.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Hosting</h4>

            <a href="https://forge.laravel.com">Laravel Forge</a>
            <p>

            <a href="https://hover.com">Hover</a>
            <p>

              customer support.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

            <p>
              I am adamant about putting every future event, including my college and work schedule, into my Calendar.
              Upcoming events are displayed on my phone and I never have to worry about missing anything.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a>
            <p>
              Did someone say productivity? Boy, does this program speed up your workflow. It's literally how I navigate

          <li>
            <a href="https://fastmail.com">FastMail</a>
            <p>
              I use this to handle my domain email addresses. $50 a year for virtually unlimited domains and aliases is
              such a great deal.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
