import Layout from '../components/Layout'

Here are the repositories of some of the projects that I've worked on. It should come as no surprise that many of them use Laravel, Vue.js, and Tailwind CSS.

Others include applications that I have made to learn a language, environment, or tool, including designing or recreating existing applications to test my skills.

#### [Tailwind CSS Preset](https://github.com/zaknesler/tailwind-preset)

An awesome minimal preset for Laravel 7+ using Tailwind CSS and Vue.js, as well as Laravel Mix and configuration for Tailwind's built-in Purge CSS. A perfect starting point for your next idea.

#### [Projects](https://github.com/zaknesler/projects) & [CSS](https://github.com/zaknesler/css)

These repositories are used to demo how to recreate sites like Google, GitHub, and Reddit using vanilla CSS and Tailwind CSS, along with any other design concepts.

#### [Java/Android Projects](https://github.com/zaknesler/java)

Code from my high school Java I (intro to Java) and Java II (Android Development) classes. These projects allowed me to understand Java more thoroughly, as well as being able to use external APIs to populate a UI.

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Layout title="Projects">
    <div className="prose dark:prose-dark">{children}</div>
  </Layout>
)
