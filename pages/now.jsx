        <h4>College</h4>
        <p>
          This year, 2021, I am completing the third year of my B.S. degree in Computer Science. My CS classes this year
          focused on Algorithms, Theory of Computation, Computer Architecture, Software Engineering, Computer Networks,
          and Principles of Programming Languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am largely self-taught, and I have been since middle school; however, my college education in my opinion is
          irreplaceable. I have learned an incredible amount, including experience working in teams, on existing code,
          with specific specifications, and focusing on performance.
        </p>

        <h4>Web Development</h4>
        <p>
          This past year or so I have been working on trying to learn more technologies, as well as improving my
          existing skills. This mainly includes learning React, Next.js, and Docker.
        </p>
        <p>
          Docker has quickly become one of my favorite tools that I now use regularly. I have converted all of my old
          projects over to Docker, and continue to use it as my main development environment.
        </p>

        <h4>Adventures into Art</h4>
        <p>
          In November 2019 I began my venture into art, where I started learning the basics of 3D using{' '}
          <a href="https://blender.org">Blender</a>, an incredibly powerful, open-source 3D suite. I have had a blast
          learning about 3D modeling, physics/fluid simulations, and creating awesome scenes in general, all using free
          tutorials on YouTube.
        </p>
        <p>
          After becoming addicted to Blender and devouring all the content I could, I switched over to learning
          traditional and digital art. This past year I have been practicing gesture, figure drawing, and anatomy,
          albeit at a snail's pace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having discovered a creative side I didn't know I had, I plan on continuing my journey into art. I try to find
          time every day to practice my skills as an artist, and I don't ever plan on stopping!
